# watkit
a package registry for handwritten WAT modules (w compiled WASM). 

## why?
∵ WAT is a very cool low level language, and the first of its kind with such a low barrier to entry (runs in browser!).  
∵ more people writing WAT by hand = more people using optimized WASM = a faster web.  
∵ less rewriting of "standard" code = more time for people to innovate with WAT.

## what does watkit include?
everything you'd expect from a package registry! that means: a cli, a website to browse packages, a way to publish packages, and a consistent package format. if you're familiar with npm, you'll feel right at home.
